        <p>My work, <i>What I want you to see</i>, explores the connection between my anxiety and outer personality. With influences such as Derek Gores and Deborah Shapiro, my work reflects the important aspects of my life by using hidden words and images that describe my personality and interests. 
          I endeavour to keep the chaos of my mind hidden by actively displaying a positive outlook to counteract my altered temperament when struggling with my anxiety. As I struggle with the commotion around me, the composition catches my response to a joke my brother has told me to keep me grounded. 
          <i>What I want you to see</i> has been created by manipulating various cuts of magazine paper. Applying layers and tonal pieces has developed the idea of texture, specifically with the hair and shirt of the portrait. A contrast is drawn between my personal inner and outer realm by juxtaposing the background and the colours of the artwork's focus.

        <p><i>Safe Haven</i> explores my inner world, where creativity is my touchstone, a refuge within the chaos of my mind and from the outside world. Influenced by Archibald Prize winner’s techniques and artists Kanō Tannyū and Anna Bocek, my work expresses essential aspects of my mind and personality. 
          When my outside environment overstimulates and collides with my chaotic thought process, I go to a room within my mind where creativity explodes around me freely. Here, my created universe becomes the way I see the world, minute details within a colourful sphere, where technology meets nature in a symbiotic way. I stand to the left of the composition overseeing my inner world yet dwarfed in real-life proportions to reflect the anxiety I feel outside of my refuge. 
          <i>Safe Haven</i> is acrylic paint on canvas board portrait, painted in a mixture of painterly and realistic techniques. The two techniques contrast, defining the chaos and messiness of my mind and the precise uniformity of what I create to keep calm.

        <p>Protection. We hide our true selves to protect our sanity, but sometimes this has the opposite effect. Using symbolism, <i>Trinity</i> explores the face I show the world and those I keep hidden. In mythology, a commonly found trait is a trinity, used to describe three figures or concepts. My portrait utilizes this trait defining the juxtaposition of struggling with my mental health caused by having Aspergers. The ambiguous faces of my self-portrait confuse and divert their attention between them, protecting my true self and emotions, their meaning deepened by the symbolically chosen colour palette of red, white and black. The portrait's lighting demonstrates the insight I have gained about three distinct elements of my personality that work as one while simultaneously showing the spotlight I constantly feel on me, causing me to burrow deeper within myself for protection.

        <p><i>Digital Avatar</i> explores my personal connection to technology and how it has improved my life while simultaneously discussing its disposal nature. Influenced by sculpture artists Yasemen Hussein, Studson Studio, Sean E Avery and Gabriel Dishaw my work demonstrates the benefits technology has had on neurodiverse people like me. 
          News outlets, medical studies and social media constantly focus on the negative aspects of our society’s reliance on technology, but we are so addicted to it are landfills are full of disposed items. Ignored are the benefits of technology and how it has significantly improved the lives of neurodiverse people, opening our worlds; allowing us to experience things and communicate with others comfortably. 
          <i>Digital Avatar</i> was created by manipulating various parts of computers to create a caricature portrait sculpture representative of my personal connection to computers. Realism has been created using texture and form, while contrasting colours emphasise the features of the work.</p>

        <p>Everyone has weaknesses. Some openly display their flaws; many others hide them, adversely affecting their mental health. My work explores the isolation that occurs by suppressing one's weaknesses. The sculpture depicts a man on a precipice, shoulders drooped, weighed down by hiding his true nature, the colour reflecting his mood, one of depression and sadness. He wears an Oni Mask to protect himself and his emotions, drawing attention away from his weaknesses. Elements of mythological allegories portray the reasons for his fractured sanity. The cliff behind him has broken; physically, mentally, and emotionally separating him from representations of past relationships and broken pieces of himself. The man stands still, choosing whether to continue forward, falling into the depths below or turning back by embracing who he is.

        <p><i>From Death comes Life</i> is open to interpretation by the audience. It can be taken literally; death must occur for life to continue. We see this all over the world from grandparents passing away and new babies being born to forests burning and regrowing. The work can also be viewed in the abstract. The loss a child feels when they realise they were born with disability before they realise its really a beautiful advantage. To allow for audience comprehension and interpretation I created this piece in the literal sense. This is demonstrated in the traditional image of Death with the work, age damaged hooded shroud over a skeletal body. Over the top life has begun to regrow with vines growing up the body and a tree cracking through the skull and blooming to life. </p>
